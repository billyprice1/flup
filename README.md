# Flup
The program powering https://lainfile.pw

A fairly simple pomf clone written from scratch in rust using Iron as a framework, and Redis as a database.

Currently is compliant to the Pomf API standard, minus CSV, who the fuck uses CSV? And especially for fucking file uploading, what the fuck?

## Principles
- If it requires JS, don't.
- If reading the code doesn't make you depressed you need to learn Rust properly.
- If you have any idea what you are doing, don't contribute.
- Keep things abstract, especially the request handler, because I might dump Iron.
- Kill yourself.

## Configuration

It's toml, learn how to use toml, why should I have to tell you how to use shit? What is this a fucking README file? Fuck you. You don't even need to, just edit the default you eejit.
